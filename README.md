# chrissx' Monitoring Solution
This aims to be a simple monitoring solution written with the suckless
philosophy in mind.
# Building
Just run `make`, all the deps are in modern Linux distros
(a modern kernel, and in my config.h ping, curl and dig).
# Installing
Just run `sudo make install`, if you have systemd.
